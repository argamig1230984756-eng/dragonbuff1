# Void Dragon – Phase 2

Standalone Paper plugin (1.21.x, Java 21) that adds a second phase to your Void Dragon fight.

## What phase 2 does
1. **Trigger** – the dragon is capped at 50% health (`phase2.health-threshold`). The hit that would pass it starts the transition instead.
2. **Transition (6s)** – dragon hovers and roars, is invulnerable, lightning hits the crystal spots, portal rings pulse, model swaps to `void_dragon_enraged`, boss bar turns red.
3. **Shielded crystals** – every pillar crystal is respawned if it was destroyed, then wrapped in a purple shield. While a shield is up:
   - it beams to the dragon and **heals it** (3 HP/s per crystal),
   - the dragon takes only **25% damage** while *any* shield is up,
   - the crystal cannot be damaged.
4. **Void Wraiths** – each shield is guarded by 3 wraiths (invisible Vex + your `void_wraith` model). Kill them all and the shield **shatters**; the crystal can now be destroyed.
5. **Regrowth** – a shattered shield regrows after 40s with 2 new wraiths, unless you destroyed the crystal. Destroyed crystal = its wraiths vanish and it stops healing the dragon.
6. **Void Rain** – every 14s up to 3 players get a closing red ring under them (2s warning), then a void blast (8 dmg, radius 3.5). Move to dodge.

Everything is in `config.yml`.

## Commands
`/voiddragon start` – spawn a dragon in the End and adopt it
`/voiddragon phase2` – force phase 2
`/voiddragon reset` – drop fight state
(permission `voiddragon.admin`)

## Hooking up your models
The fight logic never touches a model engine directly. Implement `ModelHook`
(`attachDragon`, `attachWraith`, `setDragonEnraged`, `setDragonAnimationSpeed`, `detach`)
with BetterModel or ModelEngine and register it:

    getServer().getServicesManager() ... or simply: plugin.setModelHook(new MyHook());

Do that in your own plugin right after this one enables (or merge the classes into your plugin).
Until then a logging hook is used, so the fight works with the vanilla dragon model.

Suggested mapping: `setDragonEnraged(true)` = replace the `void_dragon` model with `void_dragon_enraged`
(same bones and "fly" animation); wraiths use `void_wraith` (an `void_wraith_enraged` is included if you want
them red after phase 2).

## assets/
- `void_dragon_enraged.bbmodel/.png` – your dragon with a crimson/orange retexture (same UV layout, so you can also just swap the texture)
- `void_wraith_enraged.bbmodel/.png` – same for the wraith

## Build
    gradle build      # jar ends up in build/libs/

If you're on 1.21.3 or newer nothing needs changing (attribute lookup handles both naming schemes).

## Credit / licence note
Ideas (shielded crystals, healing beams, a stage transition, a red damaged-dragon variant) were inspired by
McMakistein's "Impossible Dragon" datapack, which is CC BY-NC-ND. No code, models or textures from it are
used here; everything in this project was written from scratch.
